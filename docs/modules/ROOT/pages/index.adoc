= Conforma CLI

The Conforma CLI is used to verify signatures and evaluate policies for
Software Supply Chain artifacts. Various sub-commands can be used to assert
facts about an artifact such as:

* Validating container image signature
* Validating container image provenance
* Evaluating {pol}[policies] over the container image provenance

This documentation includes xref:ec.adoc[Conforma Command Line reference
documentation], and documentation on the
xref:verify-enterprise-contract.adoc[Verify Enterprise Contract Task]
used to run Conforma in a Tekton pipeline.
